# zsh-todotxt
My zsh configurations wrapping todo.txt how I like

This defines a number of functions/aliases

`todo` - adds a new task, converting standalone priority letters to uppercase and wrapping them in parentheses

`I` - adds a completed task

`didlog` - runs the _lately_ plugin, reporting what's been going on

`did <#>` - Marks the item identified by `#` as completed
